Regius Mark is a cryptocurrency that is backed by physical gold assets. A single
token is backed by one physical gram of gold. Blockchain technology is used to
provide an immutable and cryptographically verified ledger. The system is
centralized allowing for global scalability that would otherwise be foregone in
a decentralized system.
